# Situation
LIF v1's goal is to provide all the information necessary to a traffic controller in order to send valid VDA5050 orders to vehicles under its control. The LIF is centered around defining navigation graphs in the context of a specific vehicle type. Station definitions may not be strictly requried to do this, since VDA5050 orders only contain `node` and `edge` objects.

# Stations in LIF v2, and Potentially Afterward
